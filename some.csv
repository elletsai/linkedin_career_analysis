As part of my project, I wrote the Product Review Document in collaboration with stakeholders like operations, product operations and the reservation team. The work involved proactively reaching out to stakeholders, gathering information, understanding how Reservations in Uber work, the pain points in the system. I closely worked with product operations and design and came up with a product and fleshed it out in the product review document. I also ensured the product impacts and meets the needs of Operations.Once the product documentation has been reviewed, I designed the architecture to build the stand-alone web application in collaboration with other engineers. I scoped out and planned the project, by breaking it down into milestones with timelines and communicated the progress with the stakeholders throughout the implementation phase. I successfully scaffolded an application, got it provisioned, configured and deployed following Uber’s toolchain. I followed an agile method of iteratively taking feedback from users and incorporating into the design. The application is built in Fusion.js, React, Redux for the front-end, Mapbox, Deck.gl for Maps, Baseweb.design for the UI, and tests are written in jest. I saw the product process from end-to-end from writing the product document to sending out a launch email to the users.

Using PacketFence the access of the devices, connected on LAN (Local Area Network), can be controlled. Current version of PacketFence does not provide GUI based Network Monitoring facility.Network monitoring system is used for continuously monitoring the devices connected in the network and that notifying the network administrator in case of outages. It is part of network management.Using the network monitoring system the user can be able to know which devices are connected with each other, connected with the LAN (Local Area Network), router, switch and different workplaces. With the help of NMS user can be able to see/monitor the whole networking systems such as switches, routers, different workplaces and user can also monitor the connectivity of other devices in the graphical form which help user/network administrator to take necessary action for diagnosing the actual problem if occurred.This project is developed using JAVA language for the front-end and Mysql as backend database. The NMS application makes SNMP queries with networking devices for getting the current information of the network devices. For Implementing SNMP query features in the project SNMP4j package is used and for implementing GUI based features open source version of JGRAPH package is used.The project helps to understand the networking devices and its functionality. It also helps to understand network security related issues.
